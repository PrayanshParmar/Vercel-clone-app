# Hostiffy - Web App Deployment Platform

Hostiffy is a full-stack platform that simplifies front-end web app deployment. It allows users to manage, deploy, and monitor their projects seamlessly with real-time feedback.

## Features

- **Multi-framework Support**: Deploy apps built with Angular, Astro, Remix, Create React App, Nuxt, Svelte, Vite, Vue, and more.
- **Real-time Logs**: Get real-time feedback on deployment processes.
- **GitHub Integration**: Select repositories directly from GitHub.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Manage projects with features like search, create, configure, view logs, and project details.
- **Secure and Scalable**: AWS infrastructure with Docker, Nginx, and ECS for scalable deployments.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- **Authentication**: [Clerk.js](https://clerk.dev)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [shadcn UI](https://shadcn.dev)
- **Real-time Logs**: Fetch logs via Kafka and display them in real-time.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for storing user, project, and deployment data.
- **Logs Database**: [ClickHouseDB](https://clickhouse.com) for storing and fetching real-time deployment logs.
- **Messaging**: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) for processing logs.
- **Containerization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for running deployment processes.

### Hosting & Deployment
- **Cloud Provider**: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
  - AWS ECS for running deployment services
  - AWS S3 for hosting built files
  - Nginx for routing subdomains

## Project Workflow

1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Select a GitHub repository and configure the project (framework support for Angular, Astro, etc.).
   
2. **Deploy the Project**:
   - On clicking deploy, a Docker container spins up on AWS ECS.
   - The app’s code is cloned, dependencies are installed, and the build is created.
   - Built files are stored in an AWS S3 bucket under the user's subdomain.

3. **Real-time Logs**:
   - Logs from the build process are sent to Kafka and stored in ClickHouseDB.
   - These logs are fetched and displayed on the frontend in real time.

4. **Post Deployment**:
   - Upon successful deployment, the user is redirected to the projects page.
   - A deployed link (e.g., `https://subdomain.app.hostiffy.xyz`) is shown, which Nginx routes to the appropriate S3 folder.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) and [ClickHouseDB](https://clickhouse.com) locally or in the cloud.
- AWS account with ECS and S3 setup.

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/hostiffy.git
   cd hostiffy
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file with necessary variables for PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, AWS, Clerk.js, etc.

4. **Run the Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Run the App**:
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```

## Deployment

Deployment is managed via Docker containers on AWS ECS.
